Come to think about it, the young lady from nassarawa, Sophia Gimba whom Mr. Peter Obi met working as a hotel attendant, but couldn't acquire a baking oven, therefore works as
a hotel attendant with a degree certificate ü§î.<br><br>
Her case is one out of million Nigerian graduates roaming streets daily and with certificate looking for jobs. Nowadays, job hunting is digital. Therefore job seekers must sit for hours, ransacking the internet for job offers. <br><br>
Similarly, many have settled to live any kind of life in order to survive ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è.<br><br>
Lots of graduates have delved into areas they do not belong to becauase they lack proper orientation at the point of joining the labor market.<br><br>
University students at the final level and fresh graduates need to be exposed to Life After School early enough. <br><br>
<i className='underline text-xl mb-2 text-center font-semibold'>
LET'S PLAY OUR PART -
</i><br>
On my own part, I feel pity for the "Common Youth" who graduates from a public University in Nigeria without any hope ü§î.<br><br>
Young graduates need our assistance. They need our guidance. They need to be told the truth about what happens in the outside world, I mean the labor market. They don't deserve to be shocked after graduation.<br><br>
Let's tell them what to expect and teach them what they need to do. In doing so, we shall make better the future of our society.<br><br>
